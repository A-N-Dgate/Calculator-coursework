This release of the calculator will only use reverse polish notation when entering an expresion 
into the calculator; if this notation isn't used, the answer will either stay as the previous
answer or 0. The change system button doesn't do anything. System tests have been done to show 
that an accurate answer can be displayed when the answer is below 11 digits, and turns to scientific 
notation at around 8 digits for the answer, if I remember correctly.
