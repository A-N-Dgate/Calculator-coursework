This release of the calculator will only use reverse polish notation when entering an expresion 
into the calculator, with only using two digits and one symbol; if this notation isn't used, the 
answer will either stay as the previousanswer or 0. The change system button doesn't do anything.
An accurate answer can be displayed when the answer is below 11 digits, and turns to scientific 
notation at around 8 digits for the answer, if I remember correctly.
